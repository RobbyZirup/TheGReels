      <h3>Account Registration</h3>
      <p>
        You will need to open an account with the casino. This is a pretty
        straightforward process, however , it’s worth noting that as part of
        this process you are now required to verify your account as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verification will mean that you have to prove both ID and address. This
        can be done by scanning or photographing documents such as passports,
        driving licenses and utility bills, to name just a few.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-top: 3em; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto">
      <h3>Locate the Bonus and Check the Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Once you are signed up it’s now time to see which bonus you want to
        claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should have done your research into the bonus before claiming, but
        it’s worth going over T’s and C’s again just to make sure. Finally,
        check if there is any bonus code needed as you can’t always enter these
        at a later date.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-top: 3em; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto">
      <h3>Clearing the Bonus</h3>
      <p>
        The hard work starts now. You need to meet the terms for the bonus and
        start clearing it as fast as you can. You should already have a plan of
        action about your process to best clear said bonus, so it’s now time to
        start implementing that.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-top: 3em; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto">
      <h3>Bonus Progress</h3>
      <p>
        Most casinos will allow you to track the progress of your bonus funds
        from your account. They aren’t always real-time, so make sure you take
        this into account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tracker will allow you to see how much of your bonus needs clearing
        and how long you have. You should be able to work out the amount you
        need to play from these two variables and the bonus wagering requirement
        for the bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        No-deposit bonuses are usually given as a gift to attract new players.
        The main goal of these bonuses is to promote the casino's brand and get
        an email address or a phone number from potential players. These
        contacts will very likely be used for marketing purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-top: 3em; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto">
      <h3>Can I claim several no deposit bonuses?</h3>

      <p>
        Only if you register at multiple casinos. At just one casino, it’s
        usually one no deposit bonus per player. We think it’s a fair rule, as
        it stops unscrupulous players abusing the system and spoiling other
        punters’ fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are unique kinds of bonuses, as they are offered as a gift by the
        casino. What the casino does is giving you (the player) free cash or
        even free spins.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the name of the bonus implies, you will not need to deposit to get
        these free spins or cash as you would have with any other type of bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, you will still need to create an account if you want to get
        the free cash or free spins unless the casino’s terms do not require you
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the cases of no deposit bonuses that give free cash, the player can
        choose any kind of game including slots or table games like poker or
        blackjack. Of course, the wagering requirements might vary depending on
        the selected game as they could not contribute in the same way to
        fulfilling it. In other cases, there will be a flat rollover requirement
        that applies to all games.
